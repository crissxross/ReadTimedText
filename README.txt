Reading Timed Text

A simple interface or tool for experimenting with various styles of animation for onscreen text.


Based on a Greensock Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find the original at http://codepen.io/GreenSock/pen/sxdfe - features include: "Duration of each chunk's animation is based on character count giving you more time to read longer chunks."
